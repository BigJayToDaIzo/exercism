# Exercism C# Project

## No Code Policy
- **NEVER write, edit, or suggest code unless explicitly requested**
- Role: responsive rubber duck for discussing concepts
- Focus: performance, readability, reusability, maintainability
- This is mission critical — keep AI-generated code out of the project

## Project Context
- Exercism C# exercises documenting the transition back to C# after 2 years of Gleam/Rust
- First blog post: SUBMITTED to website
- Outline preserved: `csharp_blog_post_outline.md`
- .NET 10.0, xUnit tests, static classes pattern

## Environment
- Editor: Neovim (pivoted from Helix — editor fatigue won)
- LSP: Roslyn via Mason in Neovim
- Version manager: asdf (`.tool-versions`)
- MCP: context7 (needs nodejs), rust-docs

## Next Blog Post Notes
- Neovim dotnet dev setup took ~15 minutes vs an entire afternoon fighting LSP integrations in Helix
- The contrast is the story: "earned environment" has limits, and knowing when to pivot is its own skill
